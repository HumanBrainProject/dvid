SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR DVID BINARY INSTALL
==========================================

Assume $DVID_DIR is the path to the "dvid-distro" directory you've untarred and uncompressed.

You will have to modify the following files:
1) config-simple.toml (or use config-full.toml if you want more complex configurations)

   Under [server] set the webclient to the $DVID_DIR/dvid-console directory.
   You can download a version of dvid-console directly from its github
   release page: http://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid-console/releases

   Under [logging] set the logfile path to a valid directory that has write 
   permissions for the user running dvid.  This directory should preferably
   be on a drive that's not being used for the actual database.  It is better
   to put logging and database files on separate storage systems.

   Under [store] set the path to the embedded basholeveldb store to a valid
   directory that has appropriate write permissions.

2) launch_dvid

   Change the DVID_DIR export to the directory with the dvid files.
   On the nohup line, make the log path agree with the path set in the
   TOML configuration file above.


When you run "launch_dvid", you should be able open a web browser and type in
a URL that corresponds to the httpAddress set in the dvid.toml file under [server].
For example:
             http://localhost:8000

You can also run dvid commands from the command line:

    % dvid about

    % dvid help
