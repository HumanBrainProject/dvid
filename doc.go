/*
	DVID is a *distributed, versioned, image-oriented datastore* written in Go that supports different
	storage backends, a Level 2 REST HTTP API, command-line access, and a FUSE frontend to at least
	one of its data types.  It has been tested on both MacOS X and Linux (Fedora 16, CentOS 6) but not
	on Windows.

	The starting point for DVID documentation is the README.md file in the DVID repo:
	https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid#dvid
